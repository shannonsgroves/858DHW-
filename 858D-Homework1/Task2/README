Run make and it should produce an executable called task2. You can then choose to create a bit vector by entering "Create" or load a bit vector from a file by entering "Load". After you enter the first command follow the outputted instructions.

Create example:

./task2
Create
$Enter number of bits: 
16
$Bitvector is : 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 
$Enter select: 
10
$Select 10 is index 15
$Time elapsed: 7.2e-05 seconds
$Overhead of rank data structure: 24 bits
$Do you want to save? (y/n)
y
$Enter filename: 
f

Load example:

./task2
Load
$Enter filename: 
f
$Enter select: 
10
