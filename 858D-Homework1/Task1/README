Run make and it should produce an executable called task1. You can then choose to create a bit vector by entering "Create" or load a bit vector from a file by entering "Load". After you enter the first command follow the outputted instructions.

Create example:

./task1
Create
$Enter number of bits: 
20
$Bitvector is : 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 
$Enter rank: 
7
$Rank at index 7 is 3
$Time elapsed: 8.7e-05 seconds
$Overhead of rank data structure: 30 bits
$Do you want to save? (y/n)
y
$Enter filename: 
f

Load example:

./task1
Load
$Enter filename: 
f
$Bitvector is : 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 
$Enter rank: 
7
$Rank at index 7 is 3
$Time elapsed: 3.1e-05 seconds
$Overhead of rank data structure: 30 bits
